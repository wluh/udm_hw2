## Question 1
Harlem and Upper Manhattan had the highest number of 311 nose complaints. I suspect that there could be several causes for these trends. The first would be inevitable noiseâ€”such as a stadium or bars. Alternatively, it could be due to population density increasing the number of calls per area but maintaining the calls per person, or just the area being noiser. Architecturural factors could also be in effect: older buildings might have less sound insulation and 
thus let more noise in.
## Question 2
Looking at the descriptor for noise complaints, midtown is generally construction complaints, which makes sense. Harlem and Upper Manhattan are generally Loud Music/Party, which would reflect on the demographics of the neighborhood. The same is said for areas in lower Manhattan.
## Question 3 
I brought in the additional data of where businesses are, thinking that businesses could be generators of noise. However, the inverse seems to be true. The more businesses an area has, the less noise complaints there are. This could be explained by the fact that noise complaints may be mostly given at night. However, businessses are closed at night, so no complaints are called in.
